## Michael James' Codewars Solutions
This repo is used to store my solutions to challenges on `codewars.com`. They are organized in folders by language. I have included a link to the problem in a comment at the top of the file when I remember to do so. The top solution is always the solution I came up with and any other solution that I found interesting, clever or concise.
